<h1>Daniel's Top Movies List</h1>
<h2>Top 10 Best Movies of All Time</h2>

<h3>Top 10: The Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>A psychological thriller that will show you how the best villian of all time can be so menacing and captivating with so little apparent power.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Top 9: Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Brilliant and surprising, a pretty innovative film that will make you go nuts.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Top 8: Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>Better than Two Towers but slighly worse than the flaship of the saga, The Return of the King.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Top 7: Lord Of The Rings: The Return of the Ring</h3>
<p>All the LOTR saga should be here. Long movies that are simply magnificent, movies that make you sad that they ended.</p>
